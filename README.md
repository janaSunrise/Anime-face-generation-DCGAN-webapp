# Anime face generation DCGAN WebApp

> A port of my Anime face generation using Pytorch into a WebApp

## Installation and usage.

This project uses `pipenv` for dependency management. You need to ensure that you have `pipenv`
installed on your system.

Here's how to quickly install the dependencies, and quickstart the web application:

- Install it using **`pipenv sync -d`**
- Once done, run the webapp using **`pipenv run start`**

And it'll start on Port `8501` by default and also it opens the site too on webbrowser.
